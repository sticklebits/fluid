        We want to understand as much as we can about your project. Why do you want to build this? Who will it serve?
        What will it do? We want to get on board with your ambition and set ourselves up for a great project.

        This phase of the process will often include a ‘Design Sprint’; a focused week of collaboration between our team

        <p>This is where your product begins to come to life.</p>
        <p> We create a set of designs for your features, constantly referring to what we’ve learnt in the discovery
            phase.
            We’ll work hard, with you, to find the perfect balance between visual aesthetics and usability. This
            includes
            designing for all eventualities: What if the user is offline? What about different devices? What happens
            when
            the
            content is loading?</p>
        <p>Our developers use these designs to build a fully functioning app, written with the future in mind and
            championing
            best practices. We make the best use of the latest techniques, such as automated testing, to produce robust,
            intuitive work. We also make the best use of being a team by peer-reviewing our work as we go along,
            checking our progress is consistently strong.</p>
        <p>Once we’re happy that we’ve built the required features, we’ll work with your team to help you test the app.
            With the features complete, we’ll walk you through the release process too.</p>

        <p>Our processes create successful products and long-lasting relationships. Most of our clients have been with us
        for
            many years.</p>

        <p>We believe that getting the first release out into the stores is only the first step in an ongoing commitment to
        excellence. We strive for continuous improvement, so we’ll
            talk to you about our ideas for your app going forward.</p>

        <p>Throughout the project we’ll be taking extensive design notes, recording technical decisions and keeping track
        of
        meeting discussions. This means that we are in a great position to pick up the project at any point in the
        future
            and carry on working together.</p>
